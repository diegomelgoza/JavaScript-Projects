# JavaScript-Projects
A list of mini projects that I have completed.

## BackgroundColor
This is a simple page that has one button. If you click the button then the background
will change colors. There is one main function that creates a random rgb color everytime the
button is clicked.

## Quote Generator
This uses the lord of the rings api to get quotes from the movie everytime the button is clicked.
